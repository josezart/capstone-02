I'm José.

a Sales Executive and Programmer.

Hello.

I am studying hard to become a Web Developer. I love music, sports and coffee.  

My Skills

Programming

I started learning to code when I was at the college because I needed to program the flight mechanics and control systems of aircraft and spacecraft. Now, I am learning Web Development through Professor Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

Sales and Negotiation

As soon as I started my professional journey, I had the opportunity to work in sales at a software company. Today, I manage a portfolio of clients that represents approximately USD 2M in annual revenue.
